Base is desktop application made in .NET Framework, using Client-Server Architecture and SQL Server as DBMS. Later on, some changes were made for better performance and easier integration with modern technologies.

- Projects in .NET Framework are upgraded to .NET Core versions (.NET 8)
- Separation of the presentation layer - desktop & web application
- Web API project created to communicate with ReactJS web application
- Asynchronic Tasks were used instead of Threads

This project is focused on showing the sustainability and ability to upgrade system without major changes to the previous structure, thanks to the layered architecture. This software has been tested and it can be used, but, as always, there is room for future upgrades and innovations.
